## Post-Recording Processing

### Using the Automated Script
```bash
# Make sure you have your recording files
# screen_recording.mov (your screen recording)
# narration.wav (optional separate audio)

# Run the video production script
./video-production.sh
```

### Manual Processing with ffmpeg
```bash
# If you have separate audio and video
ffmpeg -i screen_recording.mov -i narration.wav -c:v copy -c:a aac demo_combined.mp4

# Create intro slide
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=0x1f2937:s=1920x1080:d=3 \
  -vf "drawtext=text='SmileCoin Tourist Rewards':fontcolor=white:fontsize=60:x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2" \
  intro.mp4

# Create outro slide  
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=c=0x1f2937:s=1920x1080:d=3 \
  -vf "drawtext=text='Thank You':fontcolor=white:fontsize=60:x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2" \
  outro.mp4

# Combine all parts
echo "file 'intro.mp4'" > files.txt
echo "file 'demo_combined.mp4'" >> files.txt  
echo "file 'outro.mp4'" >> files.txt

ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i files.txt -c copy final_demo.mp4

# Optimize for web

```
