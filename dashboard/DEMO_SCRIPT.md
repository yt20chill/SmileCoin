## Narration Script (Detailed)

### Opening (0:00 - 0:20)
"Hong Kong attracts millions of tourists annually, but the current system lacks transparency and engagement. What if we could use blockchain technology to create a transparent, gamified experience that benefits tourists, restaurants, and the tourism industry? Introducing SmileCoin - the blockchain-powered tourist rewards system."

### Problem (0:20 - 0:40)
"Traditional tourism faces three key challenges: tourists lack incentives to explore diverse restaurants, restaurants struggle with visibility and customer insights, and the tourism board has limited data on visitor behavior. SmileCoin addresses all three through blockchain innovation."

### Solution (0:40 - 1:20)
"Here's how SmileCoin works: Tourists receive 10 blockchain-verified smile coins daily. They visit restaurants and scan QR codes to give 1-3 coins as appreciation. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, creating transparent rankings and valuable analytics. Complete 7 days of giving all your coins, and earn a physical SmileCoin souvenir."

### Restaurant Dashboard Demo (1:20 - 2:00)
"Let me demonstrate the restaurant dashboard. Golden Dragon Restaurant has received 1,247 smile coins from 456 transactions, ranking 8th out of 150 participating restaurants. The daily charts show consistent growth, and the tourist origin breakdown reveals visitors from the United States, UK, Japan, and four other countries. This data helps restaurants understand their international appeal."

### QR Code Demo (2:00 - 2:30)
"Restaurants generate secure QR codes containing their unique blockchain wallet address and Google Place ID. The system creates tamper-proof codes with cryptographic signatures. Restaurants print these codes and display them prominently. When tourists scan the code, they can instantly give smile coins, creating verified blockchain transactions."

### Souvenir Demo (2:30 - 2:50)
"The gamification layer encourages sustained engagement. This tourist has completed 6 out of 7 days, maintaining a perfect streak. Once they complete day 7, they'll receive a voucher for a physical SmileCoin souvenir, collectible at the Hong Kong Tourism Board office. This creates lasting memories and encourages longer stays."

### Closing (2:50 - 3:00)
"SmileCoin demonstrates blockchain's potential beyond cryptocurrency - creating transparent, engaging experiences that benefit entire ecosystems. Thank you."
