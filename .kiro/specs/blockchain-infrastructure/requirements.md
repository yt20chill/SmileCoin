# Requirements Document - Tourist Rewards Blockchain Infrastructure

## Introduction

A blockchain infrastructure system specifically designed to support the Tourist Rewards System. This system provides a cost-effective, developer-friendly API/SDK for backend developers to handle smile coin transactions, tourist wallet management, and restaurant reward tracking on a cheap blockchain network. The focus is on supporting the core tourist rewards functionality while abstracting blockchain complexity.

2. WHEN tourists give coins to restaurants THEN the system SHALL accept restaurant QR data and create verified blockchain transfers
3. WHEN querying tourist coin balances THEN the system SHALL return current balance and transaction history from blockchain
4. WHEN tracking restaurant earnings THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to query total coins received by restaurant
5. WHEN validating transactions THEN the system SHALL enforce business rules (max 3 coins per restaurant per day, coin expiration)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want an SDK for tourist rewards operations, so that I can integrate smile coin functionality with simple method calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the SDK THEN it SHALL provide JavaScript/Node.js library with tourist rewards specific methods
2. WHEN issuing coins THEN the SDK SHALL provide `issueDailyCoins(touristId, originCountry, arrivalDate)` method
3. WHEN transferring coins THEN the SDK SHALL provide `transferCoins(touristId, restaurantId, amount)` method
4. WHEN querying data THEN the SDK SHALL provide methods like `getTouristBalance()`, `getRestaurantEarnings()`, `getTransactionHistory()`
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the SDK SHALL return specific error codes for business rule violations (insufficient balance, daily limits exceeded)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use a cost-effective blockchain network, so that transaction fees remain minimal while maintaining security and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a blockchain THEN the system SHALL use Polygon, BSC, or similar low-cost EVM-compatible chain
2. WHEN processing transactions THEN the average gas cost SHALL be under $0.01 USD per transaction
3. WHEN network congestion occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable transaction confirmation times
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the chosen network SHALL support high throughput requirements
5. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL provide transaction cost analytics and alerts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want tourist and restaurant wallet management handled automatically, so that I can focus on rewards logic rather than blockchain wallet complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tourist registers THEN the system SHALL automatically create a blockchain wallet linked to their tourist ID
2. WHEN a restaurant is added THEN the system SHALL generate a wallet address linked to their Google Place ID
3. WHEN transactions occur THEN the system SHALL handle all signing and private key operations internally
4. WHEN checking balances THEN the system SHALL map tourist/restaurant IDs to wallet addresses transparently
5. WHEN securing wallets THEN the system SHALL use deterministic wallet generation tied to user identifiers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want the smile coin smart contract to handle tourist rewards business logic, so that rules are enforced automatically on-chain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the smile coin contract THEN it SHALL implement ERC-20 token with tourist rewards specific features
2. WHEN issuing daily coins THEN the smart contract SHALL mint 10 coins per tourist per day with metadata
3. WHEN transferring coins THEN the contract SHALL enforce max 3 coins per restaurant per tourist per day
4. WHEN coins expire THEN the contract SHALL automatically burn coins after 14 days
5. WHEN tracking progress THEN the contract SHALL record daily coin distribution for physical souvenir eligibility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to track all smile coin transactions for tourist and restaurant dashboards, so that I can provide transparent transaction histories and rankings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coins are issued or transferred THEN the system SHALL record transaction with tourist origin country and timestamp
2. WHEN querying tourist history THEN the system SHALL return all coin issuances and transfers with restaurant details
3. WHEN querying restaurant earnings THEN the system SHALL return all received coins with tourist origin data
4. WHEN calculating rankings THEN the system SHALL provide restaurant leaderboards based on total coins received
5. WHEN providing transparency THEN the system SHALL return blockchain explorer links for all transactions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want smile coin lifecycle management, so that I can handle daily issuance, transfers, and expiration according to tourist rewards rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tourists register THEN the system SHALL prepare their wallet for daily smile coin minting
2. WHEN issuing daily coins THEN the system SHALL mint exactly 10 smile coins with 14-day expiration
3. WHEN coins are transferred THEN the system SHALL validate business rules and update balances
4. WHEN coins expire THEN the system SHALL automatically burn expired coins and update balances
5. WHEN checking eligibility THEN the system SHALL track daily coin distribution for physical souvenir rewards

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the tourist rewards blockchain operations, so that I can ensure reliable smile coin transactions and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL track daily coin issuance rates and transaction success rates
2. WHEN blockchain errors occur THEN the system SHALL log failed transactions with tourist/restaurant context
3. WHEN gas costs spike THEN the system SHALL alert administrators about increased transaction costs
4. WHEN transaction volume increases THEN the system SHALL provide insights on tourist activity patterns
5. WHEN system health checks run THEN they SHALL verify smart contract functionality and network connectivity

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to test tourist rewards functionality locally, so that I can develop and debug smile coin operations without mainnet costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL support local blockchain networks for testing smile coin contracts
2. WHEN testing tourist flows THEN the system SHALL provide testnet configurations with pre-funded test wallets
3. WHEN running CI/CD THEN the system SHALL offer mock modes that simulate blockchain operations
4. WHEN debugging transactions THEN the system SHALL provide gas estimation for coin issuance and transfers
5. WHEN deploying environments THEN the system SHALL support dev/staging/prod configurations with different networks
